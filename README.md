# Email marketing content assistant
## Project Overview

The Email Marketing Content Assistant is a web application that simplifies the process of generating marketing emails. It empowers users to effortlessly create compelling email content tailored to their campaign goals, brand tone, industry, and additional details. The application leverages artificial intelligence to generate five email content suggestions based on the user's input.

## Tech Stack

## How It Works

1. **User Input:** Users provide campaign details, including campaign goals, brand tone, industry, and additional information through an intuitive web interface.

2. **Server-Side Processing:** The Flask backend receives user input via an HTTP POST request.

3. **AI Content Generation:** The backend utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3 API to generate five email content suggestions based on the user's provided parameters.

4. **Response to User:** The generated email content suggestions are sent back to the frontend.

5. **Display Results:** The frontend displays the five email content suggestions to the user.
